> A note on Rubocop Guard.

It has been written that Rubocop Guard implements bbatsov's github
ruby-style-guide, which attempts to foster code readability and
efficient performance.

I affirm these objectives and accept that Guard efficaciously
persues them. Therefore, I make whatever changes in my code
necessary to quiet Guard. So far I have only seen minor spacing
and quotation type offenses. These are easy enough to accomodate.

I allow that at some point a given Guard objective may diverge
from some as yet unforseen necessity. Fortunately, I have not
reached that point.
