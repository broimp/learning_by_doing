#### Regarding room.rb and table.rb

I started this program with an idea to arrange furniture according
to feng shui principles as an excuse to play with objects a bit.
In reading more, feng shui seems more about arranging rooms
in a house, the orientation of the house, colors and building 
materials - and probably not a great application for a program.

So I made a simplifying assumption to arrange some tables in a
restaurant. This program is a few baby steps in the direction of
"doing the simplest thing that could possible work."

So it prints the set of tables, then flips the ones 90 degrees that
have longer than average lengths to set a room with uniform table
spacing.

It would be nice to make the table array fit the two dimensional
room, and not just be a line of tables. It would be nice to load
a gem that does wire frame output and present output in a graphic
display. It would be nice to have other balancing and sorting
methods. It would be nice to use an object structure that could
recursively seek some optimal configuration, and I would love
advice on how to make steps in that direction.
